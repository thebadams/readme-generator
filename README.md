# Good Readme Generator
  ## Description
    
  A command line application to build good readmes
  - I was motivated to build this to ease the process of writing readmes
  - I decided to build this application to test my understanding of node and npm modules.
  - This solved the problem of the monotony of writing readme files.
  - I learned to use promises, node.js, npm, and classes for this project.
